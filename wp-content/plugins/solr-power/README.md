Search is critical for your site, but the default search for WordPress leaves a lot to be desired. Improve your user experience with the Apache Solr search engine for your WordPress website.

* Fast results, with better accuracy.
* Enables faceting on fields such as tags, categories, author, and page type.
* Indexing and faceting on custom fields.
* Drop-in support for [WP_Query](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query) with the "solr-integrate" parameter set to true.
* Completely replaces default WordPress search, just install and configure.
* Completely integrated into default WordPress theme and search widget.
* Very developer-friendly: uses the modern [Solarium](http://www.solarium-project.org/) library

## Installation ##

The Solr Power plugin can be installed just like you'd install any other WordPress plugin. Because Solr Power is intended to be a bridge between WordPress and the Apache Solr search engine, you'll need access to a functioning Solr 3.6 instance for the plugin to work as expected. This plugin does not support other versions of Solr.

If you're using the Solr Power plugin on Pantheon, setting up Apache Solr is as easy as enabling the Apache Solr add-on in your Pantheon dashboard. Once you've done so:

1. Configure which post types, taxonomies and custom fields to index by going to the **Indexing** tab of the Solr Power settings page.
2. Index your existing content by going to the plugin options screen and selecting the applicable **Actions**:
   - - **Index Searchable Post Types**
3. Search on!
4. See the examples/templates directories for more rich implementation guidelines.

If you're using the Solr Power plugin elsewhere, you'll need to install and configure Apache Solr. On a Linux environment, this involves four steps:

1. Install the Java Runtime Environment.
2. Run `./bin/install-solr.sh` to install and run Apache Solr on port 8983.
3. Configuring Solr Power to use this particular Solr instance by setting the `PANTHEON_INDEX_HOST` and `PANTHEON_INDEX_PORT` environment variables.
4. Copying `schema.xml` to the Solr configuration directory (a path similar to `solr/conf/schema.xml`).

Alternatively, there are a couple of community-maintained Docker containers you may be able to use: [kalabox/pantheon-solr](https://hub.docker.com/r/kalabox/pantheon-solr/), [kshaner/solr](https://hub.docker.com/r/kshaner/solr/).

In a local development environment, you can point Solr Power to a custom Solr instance by creating a MU plugin with:

```
<?php
/**
 * Define Solr host IP, port, scheme and path
 * Update these as necessary if your configuration differs
*/
putenv( 'PANTHEON_INDEX_HOST=192.168.50.4' );
putenv( 'PANTHEON_INDEX_PORT=8983' );
add_filter( 'solr_scheme', function(){ return 'http'; });
define( 'SOLR_PATH', '/solr/wordpress/' );
```

## Development ##

This plugin is under active development on GitHub:

[https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power)

Please feel free to file issues there. Pull requests are also welcome!

For further documentation, such as available filters and working with the `SolrPower_Api` class directly, please see the project wiki:

[https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power/wiki](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/solr-power/wiki)

You may notice there are two sets of tests running, on two different services:

* Travis CI runs the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite against a Solr instance.
* Circle CI runs the [Behat](http://behat.org/) test suite against a Pantheon site, to ensure the plugin's compatibility with the Pantheon platform.

Both of these test suites can be run locally, with a varying amount of setup.

PHPUnit requires the [WordPress PHPUnit test suite](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/), and access to a database with name `wordpress_test`. If you haven't already configured the test suite locally, you can run `bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost`. You'll also need access to a running Solr instance, in order to run the unit tests against Solr.

Behat requires a Pantheon site with Solr enabled. Once you've created the site, you'll need [install Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus#installation), and set the `TERMINUS_TOKEN`, `TERMINUS_SITE`, and `TERMINUS_ENV` environment variables. Then, you can run `./bin/behat-prepare.sh` to prepare the site for the test suite.

Note that dependencies are installed via Composer and the `vendor` directory is not committed to the repository. You will need to run `composer install` locally for the plugin to function. You can read more about Composer [here](https://getcomposer.org)

## WP-CLI Support ##

This plugin has [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/) support.

All Solr Power related commands are grouped into the `wp solr` command, see an example:

    $ wp solr
    usage: wp solr check-server-settings
       or: wp solr delete [<id>...] [--all]
       or: wp solr index [--page] [--post_type]
       or: wp solr info [--field=<field>] [--format=<format>]
       or: wp solr optimize-index
       or: wp solr repost-schema
       or: wp solr stats [--field=<field>] [--format=<format>]
    
    See 'wp help solr <command>' for more information on a specific command.

You can see more details about the commands using `wp help solr`:

    **NAME**
    
      wp solr
    
    **DESCRIPTION**
    
      Perform a variety of actions against your Solr instance.
    
    **SYNOPSIS**
    
      wp solr <command>
    
    **SUBCOMMANDS**
    
      check-server-settings      Check server settings.
      delete                     Remove one or more posts from the index.
      index                      Index all posts for a site.
      info                       Report information about Solr Power configuration.
      optimize-index             Optimize the Solr index.
      repost-schema              Repost schema.xml to Solr.
      stats                      Report stats about indexed content.


## WP_Query Integration ##

Use Solr in a custom WP_Query instead of querying a database. Add ```'solr_integrate' => true``` to the query arguments.

**NOTE:** Currently, only basic queries, tax_query, meta_query and date_query are supported. See ```examples/example.custom_WP_Query.php``` for an example.

A meta_query can use the following compare operators:

* ```'='```
* ```'!='```
* ```'>'```
* ```'>='```
* ```'<'```
* ```'<='```
* ```'LIKE'```
* ```'NOT LIKE'```
* ```'IN'```
* ```'NOT IN'```
* ```'BETWEEN'```
* ```'NOT BETWEEN'```
* ```'EXISTS'```
* ```'NOT EXISTS'```

(```'REGEXP'```, ```'NOT REGEXP'```, and ```'RLIKE'``` are not supported.)

## Configuration Tips ##

### Searching by author name ###

To support searching by author name (e.g. where "Pantheon" would return posts authored by the "Pantheon" user), add the following to your custom `schema.xml`:

```
<copyField source="post_author" dest="text"/>
```
